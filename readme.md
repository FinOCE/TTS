# TTS

TTS is a project to create automated live Reddit feeds. The internet is already plagued with random videos of automated bots generating Reddit content, but I want to turn it into a 24/7 livestream. Whether it be text-to-speech stories, comment chains, or video compilations I personally enjoy watching this form of content, so having my computer create it for me to view whenever sounds great to me!
